## Why?

So I stopped by the library planning on picking up some books on Javacsript and jQuery. While in the coding section I saw Swift 4 for beginners book. Before I started the Tech Hire OpenCode program I always thought about creating mobile applications since I am always on my phone.

Going through General Assembly has taught me how to read code. They say once you learn one langauge you are capable of learning another language. Of course every coding library and framework are not the same. Swift has no Javascript since it is not a frontend langauage. 

I'm not so great at selft-teaching but I will be using this moment as a way to get better and practice.

The name of the book is:

Swift 4 for Absolute Beginners
Develop Apps for iOS
Fourth Edition
By: Stefan Kaczmarek, Brad Lees and Gary Bennett
